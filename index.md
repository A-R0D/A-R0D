## <span style="font-size: 1.5em;">SIEM Project on Microsoft Azure</span>

I created a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system using Microsoft Azure. The project involved setting up a Virtual Machine (VM) with an open RDP port and using **Microsoft Sentinel** to monitor and detect successful RDP sign-ins. This setup allows for the continuous management of events to identify potential security risks related to Remote Desktop Protocol.

**Tools Used**:
- **Microsoft Azure** (for deploying the VM)
- **Microsoft Sentinel** (for event monitoring and detection)
- **Virtual Machine** (configured with an open RDP port)

**Key Features**:
- Monitors and logs successful RDP sign-ins.
- Custom detection rules in Microsoft Sentinel to manage events.
- Automated alerts for suspicious login attempts via RDP.

**How It Works**:
I used Microsoft Sentinel to track event logs and detect successful RDP sign-ins by creating a custom detection string.
